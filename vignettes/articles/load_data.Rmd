---

All ShinyBrAPPs use the same module to load data.

## Use the application with any endpoint
Fill all connection parameters:

- BrAPI endpoint is the web services URL
- Token: Token to be used for authorization
- cropDB: crop name to be used (for multicrop systems)

In Data Import, you can specify which kind of observations you want to import (PLOT and/or MEANS, depending of the application)  
You have to select the studies you want to import the observations from.

## Use the application directly from BMS
For BMS users, you can have the possibility to run STABrAPP directly from the study Action menu.
